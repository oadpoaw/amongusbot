> What's the default bot prefix?
The default prefix is `!` but can be changed [here](src/config.ts)

> What's Host Only?
Means that only the Voice Channel Host/Owner can execute that command

> What's Admin Only?
Means that only a Server Admin with Manage Guild permission can execute that command

> What's Invite Channel Only?
Means that command can only be executed in a certain text channel set in [findChannel](src/config.ts)

> How does the leveling system works?
You get 10-20 exp per message in every 45 seconds. This can be altered if you know how ;) <br>
This uses the formula : `f(x) = 15x^2 + 50x + 150` <br>
You can check your exp and rank using `rank` command

> Where is help command?
I didn't add one, but if you want one, feel free to make a pull request
